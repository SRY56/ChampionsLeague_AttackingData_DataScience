Task 2: Train Models
Overview of Results
The task involved predicting a target variable using regression models. Four models were trained and evaluated: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The evaluation was based on:
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values (lower is better).
•	R² Score: Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable (closer to 1 is better).
The Random Forest Classifier results are also included, providing a classification performance evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score.

Strengths and Weaknesses
1. Linear Regression
•	Strengths:
o	Simple and interpretable.
o	Computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets.
o	Performs well when the relationship between features and the target variable is linear.
•	Weaknesses:
o	Assumes linearity; struggles with non-linear relationships.
o	Sensitive to outliers, which can disproportionately affect the model’s predictions.
o	Limited flexibility to capture complex patterns.
Outcome: Linear Regression performed decently (R2=0.9806R^2 = 0.9806R2=0.9806) but underperformed compared to other models. This indicates non-linear relationships or outliers in the data that Linear Regression could not handle effectively.

2. Decision Tree Regressor
•	Strengths:
o	Captures non-linear relationships effectively.
o	Provides interpretable results with clear decision paths.
•	Weaknesses:
o	Prone to overfitting, especially without regularization (e.g., limiting tree depth).
o	Sensitive to small changes in the dataset, leading to variability in results.
Outcome: The Decision Tree achieved a perfect fit (R2=1.0,MSE=0.0R^2 = 1.0, MSE = 0.0R2=1.0,MSE=0.0) on the training data, suggesting overfitting. While it may perform perfectly on the training set, its generalization to unseen data is likely suboptimal due to its inability to handle noise or data variability effectively.

3. Gradient Boosting Regressor
•	Strengths:
o	Builds an ensemble of weak learners (trees) sequentially, minimizing errors iteratively.
o	Handles non-linear relationships and outliers better than many models.
o	Regularization techniques reduce overfitting.
•	Weaknesses:
o	Computationally intensive, especially for large datasets.
o	Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, number of trees).
Outcome: Gradient Boosting delivered the best results (R2=0.99999997,MSE=1.37e−08R^2 = 0.99999997, MSE = 1.37e-08R2=0.99999997,MSE=1.37e−08). It effectively captured complex patterns in the data and minimized errors. The model’s robustness to outliers and its ability to model non-linear relationships contributed to its superior performance.

4. Random Forest Regressor
•	Strengths:
o	Reduces overfitting by averaging predictions across multiple decision trees.
o	Robust to outliers and noise due to its ensemble approach.
o	Handles non-linear relationships effectively.
•	Weaknesses:
o	Requires more computational resources than simpler models.
